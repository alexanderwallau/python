# python
Resources, examples, funny stuff. Imagine a place.

Somebody probably did those things before me.  

## Structure
`./teaching` contains stuff I personally created to teach people things about python  
`./fun` scripts that don't have a deeper meaning / learning, just random stuff you probably shouldn't do in production ;)  
`./wtf` my favorite directory I guess. It contains scripts that mess with python specific functionalities, in a way that you can learn something new :)  

### Credits
There are some very funny repositories dedicated to similar content I found over time:
