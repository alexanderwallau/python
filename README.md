# python
Resources, examples, funny stuff. Imagine a place.

Somebody probably did those things before me.  

## Structure
`./teaching`  
contains stuff I personally created to teach people things about python  
`./exercise`  
Contains exercises I came up with at some point  
`./fun`  
Scripts that don't have a deeper meaning / learning, just random stuff you probably shouldn't do in production ;)  
`./wtf`  
My favorite directory I guess. It contains scripts that mess with python specific functionalities, in a way that you can learn something new :)  
Those scrips are accompanied by a `.md`-file giving an explanation for the behaviour._
